    Managing a Classroom

    You just got hired by a school to create some functions for their classes.

    They have already defined the objects for you. 
    
    A student has an id, a name, and an array of grades.

    An assignment has an id, a name, and the number of points that it is worth.

    A classroom has a name, a teacher, an array of students, and an array of assignments
    
    Here is an example classroom:
*/

let classroom = {
    name: "Intro to JavaScript",
    teacher: {
        name: "Mr J."
    },
    students: [
        {
            id: 11211,
            name: "Joe",
            grades: []
        },
        {
            id: 11512,
            name: "Sarah",
            grades: []
        },
        {
            id: 11314,
            name: "Harvey",
            grades: []
        },
        {
            id: 11231,
            name: "Monica",
            grades: []
        }
    ],
    assignments: [
        {
            id: 101,
            name: "Intro",
            numPoints: 5,
        },
        {
            id: 102,
            name: "Lesson 1",
            numPoints: 10,
        },
        {
            id: 103,
            name: "Lesson 2",
            numPoints: 10,
        },
        {
            id: 104,
            name: "Final",
            numPoints: 30,
        }
    ]
};

  

/*
    ----------------- API Functions ---------------------------------------

    Your job is to finish the functions below. 
    The function should match the information in the comment above it.

    A lot of these functions do similar things! 
    You should try to avoid having as much duplicate code as possible.

    The way to avoid duplicating code is by creating subroutines.  
    Create them in the Helper Functions section below. 

    There are a few there to get you started.

/*
    A note on Ids

    Putting an id on an object is extremely common in programming.
    Most database automatically generate ids when you put an object into them.

    But ids are a very important way to identify an object. If I want to get information 
    on a student, I should use their student Id.  Because maybe they changed their name!
    Or maybe there are two students with the same name.  
    Using an Id, there are never two students with the same student id. 
    
    In this exercise most of the functions use a studentId or an assignmentId.
    Below you make a function which can retrieve a student object given their studentId.
    You will want to make a similar function to getAssignmentById and put it into your 
    helper functions.
*/

/**
 * getStudentById
 * @param {object} classroom - the classroom object 
 * @param {string} studentId - the id string of a student
 * @returns {object}
 * This should return the object for the student with the given studentId
 * 
 * If the student is not found, then return null.
 */
function getStudentById(classroom, studentId) {
    // Your Code Here!
    // Look through the students list and find a student where their id matches the studentId
    // return that object.
}

/**
 * calculateGradesForAssignmentId
 * @param {object} classroom - the classroom object
 * @param {string} assignmentId - the id of the assignment
 * 
 * This should calculate the grades for every student for the given
 * assignmentId.
 * 
 * Calculate a students grade by calling the helper function calculateAssignmentGradeForStudent
 * with the student object and the assignment object.
 * 
 * If a student already has a grade for an assignment, you should not 
 * calculate them a new one.
 * 
 * Waning: the assignments may not necesarilly be graded in order!
 * Do not assume that the grades array for a student will be the correct length.
 * You should put the grade for a given assignment at the same index as the assignment
 * 
 * For example, the assignment "Lesson 1" is at index 1.
 * So every student should have their grade for "Lesson 1" in index 1 of their grades array.
 * 
 * Hint: It would be useful to make a function 
 */
function calculateGradesForAssignmentId(classroom, assignmentId) {
    // Your Code Here!

 * This will return a number, which is the students grade.

/*  -------- Helper Functions ---------------------------------------
    
    Put all of your subroutines down here.  Try to make them clean
    and reusable.  Try to use them as much as possible. 

    A few are already here for you.

    You should add at least a few subroutines!  If you do not, you will 
    lose points.

    Hint: In the grading rubric, there are 7 new subroutines.  You can have more or 
    less than that, but there are a lot of options on how to optimize your code!

    The more subroutines you write, the less overall code you will end up
    writing in the whole assignment!

    You do not need to add comments above your functions like the examples,
    those are just there to help you understand what they are doing.
